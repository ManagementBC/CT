The primary clinical outcome, HbA1c, assessed as part of quarterly standard-of-care medical visits will be extracted from the EHR over 12 months. Changes in patient-reported behavioral (diabetes self-care) and psychosocial (emotional well-being, quality of life) outcomes will be evaluated via online surveys at baseline, month 6, and month 12. A thorough process evaluation will be conducted to establish reach, acceptability/feasibility, adoption/maintenance, and fidelity of the intervention and will integrate patient and provider perspectives.

Thus, the type 1 diabetes community urgently need studies to understand and ameliorate the persistent worsening of disparities of diabetes management and outcomes in youth from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This proposed research will (1) improve representation of diverse youth in the literature, (2) address the gap in knowledge of barriers and promoters in publicly insured youth, and (3) identify and address factors of worsening disparity in diabetes technology.","detailedDescription":"As diabetes technologies have become more innovative and effective in the management of pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D), research and usage has preferentially increased only in those of higher socioeconomic status (SES). Studies have consistently demonstrated 50% lower rates of diabetes technology use in youth of lower SES. Although diabetes technology has the potential to reduce disparities in pediatric T1D outcomes, inequitable access has resulted in worsening of T1D outcomes for low SES youth. This proposal aims to build an evidence base for data-driven interventions designed to reduce disparities in diabetes innovations by addressing barriers and supporting promoters of diabetes technology use.\n\nAnanta Addala, D.O., M.P.H, is a physician scientist committed to a career as an independent investigator addressing disparities in T1D management and outcomes. Dr. Addala's longstanding research and clinical interests are to promote equitable care for youth with T1D. As a physician with a background in pediatric endocrinology, epidemiology, and behavioral health, Dr. Addala is uniquely qualified to address the drivers of inequities in diverse youth with T1D. Dr. Addala has enlisted a multi-disciplinary mentorship team comprised of experts in the fields of pediatric T1D, health disparities, statistics, and mixed method study design to successfully execute this proposal and launch an independent research career in pediatric T1D disparities.\n\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to discover drivers of disparities in diabetes technology use in youth with T1D and public insurance and develop a brief intervention, as a means to understand and address pediatric T1D disparities. This will be accomplished through two aims. In aim 1, focusing on the family, Dr. Addala will construct an evidence base of barriers and promoters to diabetes technology use in youth with public insurance in order to formulate and test a brief pilot intervention aimed at increasing uptake. In aim 2, this time focusing on the providers, Dr. Addala will construct the evidence base on barriers and promoters to recommending diabetes technology to youth with public insurance in order to formulate and test a brief pilot intervention to increase provider recommendation of diabetes technology.\n\nTaken together, findings from Aims 1 and 2 will result in the development of an intervention aimed at increasing diabetes technology uptake and access in youth from low socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minority groups, thereby improving T1D outcomes. Dr. Addala will use the K23 mentored award to execute an in-depth training plan which includes formal coursework and structured mentorship by her mentors to advance her understanding of mixed methods research, intervention development, and expertise on disparities. This proposal is foundational to a future independent clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the interventions developed on promoters and barriers of diabetes technology use in youth with T1D and public insurance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes"],"keywords":["Health Disparities","Diabetes Technology","Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes","Health Equity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pilot Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The design for this phase is a prospective pilot study.

If proven effective, such a strategy can be used as a therapeutic option for T1D patients and potentially other autoimmune disorders.","detailedDescription":"This study seeks to find and enroll participants between the ages of 18 to 30 with new onset Type 1 diabetes (T1D) within 6 months of the first dose of insulin. T1D is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia in patients. Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"],"keywords":["mesenchymal stem

This intervention is grounded in self-determination theory which states that a youth who believes their diabetes management is self-directed, competent, and supported by others is more likely to consistently complete their diabetes self-care. This theory-driven intervention will be scalable to a variety of chronic illness contexts and the knowledge gained from this research will inform self-determination theory and different interventions targeting this population (currently there are no interventions that directly target emerging adults).","detailedDescription":"This project will use the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) approach to test the efficacy of an autonomy supportive behavioral intervention to improve metabolic control among older adolescents and emerging adults (16-25) with T1D. Youth this age demonstrate chronic poor metabolic control that persists into adulthood leading to the premature emergence of short- and long-term diabetes complications. Developmentally, adolescence and emerging adulthood is a time when the need for independence and autonomy are particularly salient. This new intervention will leverage youths' desire for autonomy by designing an intervention to support diabetes self-management autonomy. This intervention is guided by self-determination theory (SDT) which suggests that autonomous (i.e., self-initiated, driven by intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation) diabetes management depends upon three conditions: 1) the perception that one's behavior is self-directed, 2) feelings of competence, or self-efficacy, and 3) the existence of caring relationships supportive of the behavior. The investigators have identified three intervention components that target the SDT constructs. A question prompt list (QPL) is a simple, inexpensive tool comprised of a list of questions that patients might consider asking their health care provider during a clinic visit. QPLs empower patients to assume a more active role (asking questions and stating concerns) during clinic visits. The Motivation Enhancing System (MES) is an eHealth intervention to increase intrinsic motivation for health behavior change. MES content is based on the Motivational Interviewing (MI) framework and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health behavior change which posits that behavior change results from the joint function of three critical components: accurate information about risk behaviors or their replacement health behaviors, motivation to change behavior, and behavioral skills necessary to perform the behavior (self-efficacy). Text message reminders (TXT) are a strategy to encourage youth to complete their diabetes self-care that also lead to gains in self-efficacy and a stronger relationship with diabetes care providers through greater communication and satisfaction. The investigators will test the efficacy of these intervention components toward improving metabolic control in a component selection experiment (N=320). The experiment will use a full factorial research design with random assignment to determine which intervention components contribute to a clinically significant improvement (≥0.5%) in HbA1c. The result of this research will be an optimized, multi-component intervention with effect size estimates that will be used to inform a large scale, fully powered effectiveness trial. This theory-driven intervention will be scalable to a variety of chronic illness contexts and the knowledge gained from this research will inform self-determination theory and behavioral interventions targeting this population (for which there currently are none)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"],"keywords":["emerging adults","ehealth intervention","diabetes","diabetes management","adolescents","self-determination theory"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"The study will use an 8-arm full factorial design.

We will conduct five distinct experiments to test this hypothesis in patients with T2D and T1D.\n\nSTUDY 1: To examine the effect of empagliflozin versus empagliflozin/pancreatic clamp on EGP (6,6, D2-glucose), gluconeogenesis (D2O), lipolysis (U-2H-glycerol), ketogenesis (13C-palmitate conversion to 3-betahydroxybuyrate), and norepinephrine turnover (3H-NE) in type 2 diabetes subjects.\n\nSTUDY 2. To examine the role of the SNS on the empagliflozin-induced stimulation of EGP, lipolysis, and ketone production in T2D by comparing the effect of empagliflozin versus empagliflozin plus propranolol.\n\nSTUDY 3. To examine the 2-HIT hypothesis that the SGLT2i-induced stimulation of EGP, lipolysis, and ketone production requires the combination of volume depletion plus insulinopenia in T2D individuals.\n\nSTUDY 4. To examine whether the empagliflozin-induced stimulation of EGP, lipolysis, and ketone production in T2D individuals can be blocked by pioglitazone (which has direct hepatic and adipose tissue effects).\n\nSTUDY 5. To examine whether the empagliflozin-induced stimulation of EGP, lipolysis, and ketone production in T1D individuals can be blocked by pioglitazone (which has direct hepatic and adipose tissue effects).","detailedDescription":"STUDY 1\n\nParticipants: 30 T2D subjects, age = 30-75 y, BMI = 23-38 kg/m2, HbA1c = 7.0-10%, eGFR \\> 60 ml/min/1.73m2, BP \\< 145/85 mmHg. Participants must be in general good health based on medical history, physical exam, screening blood chemistries, CBC, TSH/T4, EKG, and urinalysis. Patients must have stable body weight (±1.5 kg) over the last 3 months and must not participate in an excessively heavy exercise program. Patients treated with diet, SU, metformin, or SU/MET are eligible. Patients treated with GLP-1 RA, DPP-4i, TZD, or insulin are excluded. Patients taking medications (other than SU/MET) known to affect glucose metabolism are excluded. Statin therapy is permissible if the dose has been stable for at least 3 months. Subjects with evidence of proliferative retinopathy or eGFR \\< 60 are excluded. Women of childbearing potential are excluded unless they are taking/using appropriate contractive medications/devices.\n\nProtocol: Subjects will be randomized to receive empagliflozin (n=20) or placebo (n=10) in 2:1 ratio. Subject stratification will be done according to the following parameters: age (\\> or \\< 50 y), BMI (\\> or \\< 30 kg/m2), eGFR (\\> or \\< 80 ml/min/1.73 m2), HbA1c (\\> or \\< 8.5%). Each subject will participate in two studies performed in random order with 7-10 day interval between studies. In Study 1a, EGP will be measured with a prime-continuous 6,6, D2-glucose infusion and lipolysis will be measured with prime-continuous infusion of U-2H-glycerol. The rate of ketogenesis will be determined by infusion of 13C palmitate and quantitating the enrichment of 13C in 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Total body NE turnover will be measured with 3H-norepinephrine (3H-NE) infusion before and after empagliflozin administration. Study 1b will be similar to Study 1a with one exception. EGP, lipolysis, and ketogenesis, and NE turnover will be measured under pancreatic clamp conditions.\n\nSTUDY 2\n\nParticipants: 22 T2D subjects with identical characteristics as in Study 1.\n\nProtocol Study 2a: Following a 10-hour overnight fast, a prime-continuous infusions of 6,6,D2-glucose and U-14C-glycerol are started and continued to study end to measure rates of HGP and lipolysis. At 8:00AM a prime-continuous infusion of 3H-norepinephrine is started and continued to 9:00 AM at which time it will be stopped. At 11:00PM on the night prior to study subjects will ingest D2O (3 grams/kg ffm) to quantitate gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis as previously described. At 7:30AM (2.5 hours after the start of tracer infusions) arterialized blood samples will be obtained at -30, -20, -10, 5, and 0 minutes for determination of plasma glucose, FFA, glycerol, AcAc, BHB, insulin, glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine concentrations, 6,6D2-glucose enrichment, and 3H-NE and 14C-glycerol specific activities. At -30 and -10 minutes plasma glucose and VLDL samples are obtained to measure gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis. At time zero (9:00 AM) subjects will ingest empagliflozin (25 mg) and arterialized blood samples are obtained every 10-30 minutes for 300 minutes (study end) for all of the preceding plasma substrate, hormone, and isotope specific activity/enrichment measurements. At 240 minutes (1:00 PM) a second prime-continuous 3H-NE infusion is started for 60 minutes. Plasma samples for norepinephrine concentration and specific activity are obtained every 5-10 minutes over the 30 minutes prior to the start of 3H-NE infusion and from 260-300 minutes.\n\nProtocol Study 2b: This study will be identical to Study 2a above with one exception. 30 minutes prior to the ingestion of empagliflozin (8:30 AM), a prime (200 ug/kg over 20 minutes)-continuous (80 ug/min) infusion of propranolol is started and continued to study end. We previously have shown the steady state propranolol concentration achieved by this infusion rate is sufficient to significantly inhibit insulin-mediated glucose disposal.\n\nSTUDY 3\n\nParticipants: 29 T2D subjects with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as in Study 1. Subjects will participate in 4 studies that will be performed in random order on the CRC at TDI at 6 AM.\n\nProtocol Study 3a: Infusions of 3-3H-glucose and U-14C-glycerol will be started as per Study 2 and continued until the end of study at 2:00 PM. Plasma concentrations of glucose, FFA, glycerol, AcAc, BHB, insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, renin and angiotensin (index of volume status) and 3H-glucose and 14C-glycerol specific activities will be measured at -30, -20, -10, -5 and 0 minutes. At time zero (9:00 AM) subjects will ingest empagliflozin (25 mg). Plasma substrate and hormone concentrations and 3H-glucose/14C-glycerol specific activities will be measured every 10-30 minutes for 300 minutes (2:00 PM) as per Study 2. Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, renin, and angiotensin will be measured at 270, 280, 290, and 300 minutes.\n\nProtocol Study 3b: At 7 AM an infusion of normal saline will be started at the rate of 150 ml/hour and continued to the end of study at 2 PM (total volume = 1050 ml; total Na and Cl = 154 meq). This amount of volume and NaCl administration is approximately twice the amount of urinary NaCl and volume that occurs over the initial 24 hours when dapagliflozin is initially administered as a single dose to T2D patients, as previously shown by us. In addition, all blood loss will quantitatively be replaced by an equivalent amount of normal saline.\n\nProtocol Study 3c: This will be similar to Study 3a with one exception: at 9 AM somatostatin with insulin and glucagon replacement will be given to create volume depletion without insulinopenia.\n\nProtocol Study 3d: This will be similar to Study 3a with two exceptions: (i) volume repletion will be given as in Study 3b and (ii) somatostatin will be infused with insulin and glucagon replacement as in Study 3c.\n\nSTUDY 4\n\nParticipants: 64 T2D subjects with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as Protocol 1. Subjects with hematuria are excluded.\n\nProtocol: Infusions of 3-3H-glucose and 14C-glycerol are started and continued to study end (2 PM). Baseline blood samples for HbA1c (x2) and for plasma insulin, glucagon, glucose, FFA, BHB, AcAc, glycerol, and plasma 3-3H-glucose and 14C-glycerol specific activities are drawn at -30, -20, -10, -5, and 0 minutes for measurement of lipolysis, ketone production (plasma ketone levels), and EGP. Empagliflozin (25 mg) is ingested at time zero (9AM) and plasma samples for the above are obtained every 10-20 minutes.\n\nFollowing completion of the above study, subjects will be randomized to one of four groups (16 per group) for 10 weeks: (1) empagliflozin, 25 mg/day, plus pioglitazone placebo; (2) pioglitazone, 15 mg/day, increased to 30 mg after 2 weeks plus empagliflozin placebo; (3) empagliflozin (25 mg/d) plus pioglitazone (15/30 mg/d); (4) empa placebo plus pio placebo. Subjects will return to the CRC every 1-2 weeks for interim medical history, to check medication compliance, and to measure plasma insulin, glucagon, glucose, FFA, glycerol, BHB, and AcAc levels. At week 10, subjects will return to the CRC at 6AM and the baseline study will be repeated. HbA1c will be measured twice during week 10.\n\nSTUDY 5\n\nParticipants: 24 T1D subjects will comprise the study population. Inclusion criteria are: (1) age \\> 18 years; (2) T1D with positive GAD antibody; (3) subjects must be in good general health (except for diabetes) as determined by physical exam, medical history, Chem 20, CBC, T4/TSH, urinalysis, and EKG; (4) fasting C-peptide concentration \\<0.7 ng/ml; (5) poor glycemic control (HbA1c = 7.0-11.0%); (6) treatment with multiple daily insulin injections (basal plus prandial) or insulin pump; (7) stable insulin dose (±4 units in the preceding three months; (8) eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2; (9) weight stable over the preceding 3 months (±4 pounds); (10) do not participate in an excessively heavy exercise program. Exclusion criteria: (1) T2D; (2) HbA1c \\<7.0% or \\> 11.0%; (3) eGFR \\< 60 ml/min/1.73m2; (4) hematuria in urinalysis;( 5) pregnancy or lactating; (6) major organ system disease other than diabetes; (7) evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy; (8) patients on ketogenic diet; (9) history of hospitalization for DKA, hypoglycemia or uncontrolled hyperglycemia in preceding 6 months.\n\nSubjects will receive fasting measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP1, GIP, HbA1c, FFA, glycerol, BHB, AcAc, lactate and started on a 4 week run-in period during which they will be instructed to continue their daily insulin regimen unchanged unless instructed otherwise by the study team and to continue 4 times/day home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) (before each meal and bed time). To determine the baseline rate of hypoglycemia, CGM (Dexcom G6) will be performed during the last week of the run in period. Subjects with evidence of hypoglycemia or who have FPG \\< 120 mg/dl will have their daily insulin dose adjusted to achieve a mean FPG \\> 120 mg/dl as confirmed by CGM. Since the primary aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of SGLT2i with and without pioglitazone, no adjustment in insulin dose will be done during the run in period or at the time of starting empagliflozin (see below) in patients with FPG \\> 120 mg/dl in order not to increase the risk of ketoacidosis.\n\nProtocol: Infusions of 3-3H-glucose and U-14C-glycerol will be started as described in the \"BASELINE\" study of Study 4. All blood sampling will be performed as in Study 4 with empagliflozin (25 mg) ingested at 9 AM (time zero). Following completion of this \"BASELINE\" study, subjects will be randomized to: (1) empagliflozin, 25 mg/day, plus placebo for 10 weeks or (2) empagliflozin (25 mg/d) plus pioglitazone (15 mg/d for 2 weeks, then increased to 30 mg/d for 8 weeks for a total treatment period of 10 weeks). Changes in daily insulin dose will be allowed after starting empagliflozin to avoid hypoglycemia and will be made based upon HBGM and CGM at the investigator's discretion. Plasma ketone concentration will be measured by the patient with a Keto-Mojo Meter for 3 days following any insulin dose adjustment before making any additional changes in insulin dose.\n\nFollowing the start of empa/placebo or empa/pioglitazone, subjects will return to the CRC every 1-2 weeks for review of CGM and HBGM results and blood will be drawn for fasting plasma insulin, glucagon, glucose, FFA, glycerol, AcAc, and BHB. Patients will be instructed to measure plasma ketone conc (Keto-Mojo Meter) each morning. If the plasma ketone conc rises to \\> 1 mM, subjects will be instructed to immediately contact the study team, and all fasting measurements will be repeated . After 10 weeks the \"BASELINE\" study will be repeated. HbA1c will be measured twice during week 10."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes","Type 1 Diabetes"],"keywords":["Pancreatic clamp","Endogenous glucose production","Ketogenesis","Gluconeogenesis","Lipolysis","Norepinephrine turnover"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized controlled 4 arm clinical trial comprised of 5 studies","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Subjects will be randomly assigned 2:1 active drug:placebo.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":169,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Empagliflozin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Empagliflozin 25 mg/day","interventionNames":["Drug: Empagliflozin 25 MG"]},{"label":"Placebo/Control Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo control","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"Pioglitazone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pioglitazone 30 mg/day","interventionNames":["Drug: Pioglitazone 30mg"]},{"label":"Empagliflozin + pioglitazone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Combination of empagliflozin (25 mg/day) plus pioglitazone (30 mg/day)","interventionNames":["Drug: Pioglitazone 30mg + Empagliflozin (25 mg)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Empagliflozin 25 MG","description":"A medication used in the management and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A randomized, controlled, repeated measures design will be used. The study will use a sample of 216 Black adolescent-caregiver dyads. Participants will be recruited at two sites (University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center/ LeBonheur Children's Hospital and Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC). 108 families will be recruited at each of the two sites. Wayne State University (WSU) will function as the coordinating center for the trial and will be responsible for overseeing the adequacy of all aspects of trial management.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive The 3Ms 2.0 plus standard medical care or EAC plus standard medical care. In the 3Ms 2.0 condition, primary caregivers will receive a brief (10-20 minute) 3 session computer-delivered intervention via their mobile device. The intervention is designed to increase parental daily supervision of adolescent diabetes management. In the control condition, primary caregivers will also receive 3 brief computer-delivered sessions where the content is information and facts about type 1 diabetes. The intervention content will be available to the primary caregiver during a six month window and can be completed at their convenience.\n\nData collection occurs in the families' home at baseline (T1), three months post-baseline (corresponding with the midpoint of the intervention window) (T2), six months post- baseline (corresponding with the end of the intervention window) (T3) and 12 months post-baseline (T4). Data completion can be completed via the Internet should families live outside a reasonable driving distance from the recruitment site. Data collection is completed by the adolescent and caregiver on a tablet computer and includes questionnaires to assess adolescent diabetes management, parental supervision of diabetes management, family relationships and youth quality of life. Blood will also be collected to measure HbA1c (mean blood glucose level). Medical record data will also be collected.\n\nThe data analyses will be intent-to-treat, meaning that all randomized participants are included regardless of the intervention dose received.

Our specific aims are to 1) evaluate T1D-CATCH effects on technology initiation and continued use over 6 months and 2) evaluate T1D-CATCH implementation using Proctor's Taxonomy of Implementation Outcomes: feasibility, adoption, fidelity, and cost.","detailedDescription":"The study will involve a 9-month randomized control trial of usual care versus T1D-CATCH, an intervention that enhances core community health worker (CHW) service roles to support increased use of T1D technology in young adults (underrepresented minorities)(YA_URM's). Participants will be recruited from primary and specialty care practices at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY, which is a large safety-net hospital system in one of the poorest counties in the U.S. Two young adult-aged CHWs from the Montefiore CHW program will be trained extensively per our Supporting Emerging Adults with Diabetes (SEAD) program manuals. For YA-URMs, CHWs will conduct hands-on diabetes technology education, goal-setting, peer support, and social service linkage. CHWs will also help shift insurance approval tasks away from busy providers and better align patient-provider priorities through close communication between the YA-URM and provider. Group sessions will be optional and will follow the YA-centric education curriculum developed in Dr. Agarwal's Supporting Emerging Adults with Diabetes (SEAD) program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes","Type 1 Diabetes","Young Adult","Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"9-month randomized controlled trial in which YA-URMs will be randomized to T1D-CATCH or usual care","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Participants will be randomized after enrollment into the study using REDCap.

CHWs engender trust with patients by having direct community and lived experience, offering specific support and empathy that may be difficult for other diabetes care professionals to provide. In addition, CHWs have firsthand understanding of cultural barriers to traditional western healthcare and can promote patient-centered culturally-relevant care. They enhance team-based care by helping providers with extra outreach, social needs management, time-consuming tasks, and aligning patient-provider priorities.\n\nCHWs in this project will provide

It helps reduce blood pressure, promote weight loss, lower insulin resistance and improve glucose and lipid (triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol) profiles. Unfortunately, the benefits of exercise are often not embraced by diabetic individuals because of the fear of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). My laboratory has demonstrated that Autonomic nervous system (ANS) counterregulatory failure plays an important role in exercise associated hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM. ANS responses are significantly reduced in Type 1 DM and are further blunted by antecedent episodes of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, there is a large sexual dimorphism of reduced ANS responses during submaximal exercise in both Type 1 DM and healthy individuals that is unexplained. Accumulating data are demonstrating that serotonergic pathways can regulate ANS discharge. Generally, serotonergic pathways are inhibitory but both single and longer term administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) such as Prozac has been demonstrated to increase basal epinephrine levels and enhance baroreflex control of Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. What is unknown is whether fluoxetine can also enhance SNS responses and also override the large ANS sexual dimorphism present during sub maximal exercise. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if the SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac) can improve SNS responses during exercise."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes","Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure"],"keywords":["exercise","diabetes","SSRIs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Trial 1-SSRI","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"90 minute exercise baseline with 6 weeks treatment with SSRI (Prozac).

Since obesity runs in families and carries risk for poor outcomes psychologically and medically, the investigators are adapting our successful evidence-based Family Based Treatment for hybrid delivery to improve obesity and metabolic control in the affected youth and improve obesity and related co-morbidities in their parents.","detailedDescription":"The investigators are conducting a 6-month (26 weeks) pilot trial enrolling 20 patients (6-17-year-old) with T1D and overweight/obesity and at least one parent with overweight/obesity and at least one associated co-morbidity, such as hypertension, pre-diabetes/T2D, or hyperlipidemia. The investigators realize that the age range chosen encompasses different developmental ages and are prepared to make some adaptations based on the intellectual and developmental abilities of the youth. For example, young children react very well to games related to food choices. Participants will have T1D duration \\>1 year (to exclude patients in the partial remission period), receive insulin therapy via pump or multiple daily injections, and wear a continuous glucose monitor. Both insulin regimens paired with continuous glucose monitor allow comparable potential to achieve optimal diabetes control. This study will test the feasibility of delivering an FBT intervention with a strong behavioral component to treat overweight in BOTH child and parent. The investigators will provide the participants with Body Trace Weight scales and instruct parents and youth to check their weight twice/week. The purpose of weight checking between in-person meetings is for the family coach to help the parent (and the child is old enough) relate weight changes to diet and activity habits/healthy behaviors and to develop plans to address weight gain relapse when needed. The choice of the Body Trace Weight scale is because it is a cellular enabled scale that will work even if there is a lapse in Wi-Fi availability and is user friendly without complicated set up procedures. Moreover, the investigators have already purchased them and will not need funding for them.\n\nThe intensity of the proposed schedule is in keeping with the treatment dose recommended by the United States Preventive Task Force recommendations. The coaching sessions will occur weekly for nine weeks (week 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7, 8), followed by sessions every two weeks for two months (wks. 10,12,14,16, 18), and then 2 sessions at a monthly interval (wks. 22 and 26). As described in the table below, the intensity of contact needs to be greater initially because this facilitates change in habits. However, \"lack of time\" is a major barrier to the acceptance of FBT programs for treatment of overweight and ultimately in the translation and dissemination of successful programs. Therefore, to overcome this barrier, after the initial four in person (IP) sessions, the investigators will alternate IP with virtual (V) meetings. Moreover, the investigators will coordinate the standard of care diabetes follow-ups (needed every 10-12 weeks) at the same time of the coaching sessions (IP + clinic at week 0-12 and 26).\n\nWk 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 22 26 IP+ CLINIC IP IP IP V IP V IP V V IP + CLINIC V IP V IP IP + CLINIC The coordination of the sessions with the standard of care visit will also involve the patient's diabetologist in following the patient's progress, providing positive feedback and learning from this program. From a practical standpoint, out of the 14 planned sessions, 6 will be virtual sessions, 3 will be in-person coordinated with the diabetes standard of care follow-up outpatient appointment, and seven would be in-person sessions. The investigators have experience with virtual delivery of FBT in the primary care setting during the COVID pandemic. Moreover, patients with T1D are accustomed to the use of digital health to upload their pump and sensors/glucose monitors. The investigators have conducted a 4-week pilot on the use of Wi-Fi scales in ten children 2-8 years old and their mothers (6/10 overweight or obese) who were instructed to monitor their weight and the child's weight twice week for a total of 8 times. 8/10 mothers monitored their weight and that of their child 7/8 times.\n\nThe investigators have considered the possibility of group sessions which foster learning and peer support and are cost-effective. Group education has been adopted especially in adults with T2D. While the investigators have conducted FBT group meetings in many instances in the past, they have been coupled with 1:1 meeting to tailor coaching to the particular needs of a participant and to \"make up\" missed group sessions. T1D is a chronic and very taxing disorder for patients and families. The coordination of group meetings imposes a \"fixed day and time\" regimen that cannot be met by many parents who need flexibility and tends to exclude single parents and those families who have health and socio-economic inequities, who could benefit the most from coaching. In the recently completed PLAN grant, a multicenter FBT implemented in the primary care setting the investigators adopted a 1:1 strategy which has allowed us to recruit 43% of minority families and 17% with income at the poverty line or below.\n\nOur FBT curriculum, which has been delivered successfully in the specialty and primary care settings, has 3 components: 1. Meal planning including quality of carbohydrates and glycemic index for both parents and children while ensuring that youth have a balanced meal plan with adequate amounts of carbohydrates for optimal growth. Our FBT has a focus on \"Food Literacy\" including healthy food selection and sourcing of affordable healthy food, food preparation and preplanning, social engagement tailoring the meal plan to the needs to the family in socio cultural appropriate way and also feasibility based on logistics and economic aspects; 2. Physical activity (PA) component with shaping strategy to allow for a progressive shaping of easy PA starting, if needed, with as little as with 10 minutes of walking/day and strategies to incorporate PA in daily routines, family, and social activities; 3. Extensive behavioral component which has been shown to be very powerful in FBT for obesity and will be tailored to the needs of the patient with T1D. The program will focus on energy reduction, increased PA, and behavioral techniques to develop and sustain healthy habits conducive to reach healthy weight while balancing glycemic targets.\n\nIn the past, the investigators have compared the FBT intervention in a randomized fashion to an Education Control arm, where parents (and children if old enough) would receive education regarding meal planning and physical activity pertaining ONLY to the child (targeting child only) without a behavioral component and without treating the parent. This modality of controls for attention and still provides some benefit but not the same degree of weight loss. However, for this proposal, the investigators will deliver the treatment to 20 families without randomizing to a control arm because this is the first time the investigators are adapting our successful evidence based FBT for treatment of obesity in the general population to treat patients with T1D and obesity and their parents with obesity and related co-morbidities. Moreover, it is also the first time that the protocol (outside of pandemic constraints) includes a mix of in-person and virtual treatments. Therefore, with the limited time and funding, the investigators feel that the first step in this adaptation is to demonstrate that FBT to a new population using a hybrid program do work. The investigators propose, however, to compare the FBT intervention to a standard of care control group of patients matched for gender, age and HbA1c to the participants in this study. The investigators acknowledge that the major limitation of this control group is the fact that there is not randomization and also that the investigators will not be collecting parental data. Yet this, coupled with the change that each patient and parents will have compared to baseline, will give us some solid preliminary data to judge the effectiveness of the program and provide data for power calculations for extramural application supporting a randomized trial.\n\nIn contrast to Type 2 diabetes, T1D is not more prevalent in Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC). However, the highest rate of obesity in patients with T1D is indeed seen in patients with socio-economic disparities and minority status, and the investigators will prioritize enrollment of these patients. The investigators are aware of the inequities caused by the digital divide. The choice of cellular scales that enable communication during internet lapses was made to assist families who may have socio economic difficulties. The majority of these families still have cellular phones which will allow virtual contact. Therefore, the investigators will use some of the funds to help families with socio-economic disparities afford internet (if they do not have it) and a means to communicate electronically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1","Obesity, Childhood","Overweight","Comorbidities and Coexisting Conditions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"20 Child-Parent Dyads","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Family-Based Behavioral Treatment","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Family-Based Treatment for T1D"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Family-Based Treatment for T1D","description":"Our FBT curriculum, which has been delivered successfully in the specialty and primary care settings, has 3 components: 1.

In diabetic patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, a rise in plasma ketone concentration consistently has been observed. This has led to the \"ketone hypothesis\" in which a shift from glucose/FFA (Free Fatty Acids) to ketone utilization by the heart results in enhanced left ventricular systolic/diastolic function and could, at least in part, explain the reduction in CV mortality and hospitalization for heart failure observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.\n\nMethods Type 2 diabetic subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-III heart failure and ejection fraction less than 50% will be studied. Eligible subjects will undergo a baseline cardiac MRI to obtain quantitative measures of baseline cardiac functional parameters: chamber volumes and pressures, wall thickness, LV diastolic function (E/A ratio, peak LV filling rate, diastolic volume), LV systolic function (cardiac output, stroke volume, systolic volume, peak LV ejection rate). Baseline samples will be drawn for measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) , B-OH-butyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, FFA, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, HCO3 (bicarbonate), insulin, glucagon, renin and aldosterone. Following completion of the baseline MRI and blood samples, subjects will be divided into three groups (12 subjects per group). Each group will receive a 6-hour (3-hour in group III) prime-continuous infusion of racemic B-OH-B (100 mg/mL solution; pH adjusted to 7.4) to increase the plasma B-OH-B concentration by \\~0.5, \\~2.0, and \\~5.0 mmol/L. At the end of the infusion the MRI will be repeated. As a time control GROUP II subjects will receive a continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate (0.12 M) for 6 hours (0.08 mg/kg/min) to mimic the rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration observed with B-OH-B infusion. Group II will return again to the RII (UT Health Research Imaging Institute) on a separate day for a cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) study to examine the effect of hyperketonemia on myocardial glucose uptake and blood flow. In \\~14 days subjects will return for a repeat PET/18F-2-DOG (deoxyglucose) study with one exception: NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate) will be infused instead of B-OH-B.

Achieving glycemic targets is associated with reduced risk of micro-and macrovascular complications. Sleep deprivation leads to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adults without chronic conditions and with T1D. Promoting sleep in laboratory and natural environments contributes to improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose levels, and distress symptoms in young adults without chronic conditions and more time in range in adolescents with T1D. Multiple dimensions of sleep health (alertness, timing, efficiency, and sleep duration) are associated with better achievement of glycemic targets in adults with T1D. Therefore, sleep health dimensions are appropriate therapeutic targets to improve glucoregulation and other diabetes self-management outcomes in this population.\n\nOur primary objective is to evaluate the immediate and short-term effects of a 12-week CB-sleep intervention compared to enhanced usual care (time balanced attention control) on actigraphy- and self-report derived sleep health dimensions and diabetes self-management outcomes (glycemia and distress symptoms) over 9-months (Stage II of the NIH Model for Behavior Change, ORBIT phase III). CB-sleep is guided by principles and practices from motivational interviewing and the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change with interactive stage-matched sessions.","detailedDescription":"Overview: The investigators will conduct a powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) and recruit a contemporary cohort of 248 young adults with T1D and randomly assign them to one of two conditions: CB-sleep or a time-balanced attention control (enhanced usual care) condition.

Yet, type 1 diabetes is a complex disease with pathophysiology that extends beyond beta-cell injury and insulin deficiency to include insulin resistance and renal vascular resistance, factors that accelerate cardiovascular disease risk. We have shown that metformin improved peripheral insulin sensitivity and vascular stiffness in youth with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections or standard insulin pumps. However, metformin's effect on kidney and endothelial outcomes, and the effects of type 1 diabetes technologies, with or without metformin, on any cardiovascular or kidney outcome, remains unknown. Automated insulin delivery systems combine an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor, and control algorithm to modulate background insulin delivery and decrease peripheral insulin exposure while improving time in target range and reducing hypoglycemia. We hypothesize that automated insulin delivery systems, particularly when combined with metformin, may modulate renal vascular resistance and insulin sensitivity, thereby impacting cardiometabolic function. MANATEE-T1D is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 4 months of metformin 2,000 mg daily in 40 youth aged 12-21 years with type 1 diabetes on automated insulin delivery systems vs. 20 control youth with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections plus a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump in manual mode plus a continuous glucose monitor which will assess for changes

The objective of this study is to determine whether metoclopramide can improve hypoglycemia awareness and decrease the incidence of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.","detailedDescription":"Hypoglycemia is the most prevalent clinical complication in the daily management of diabetes and is the major obstacle to normalizing blood sugar. For people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF) increases the risk for severe hypoglycemia by a factor of 25 or more. A major component of HAAF is hypoglycemia unawareness (perhaps more accurately defined as impaired awareness of hypoglycemia), which involves in the loss/diminution of warning symptoms to hypoglycemia that would normally prompt a corrective behavioral response (e.g., eating food). Approximately 25-40% of people with T1DM report hypoglycemia unawareness. This value is most certainly an underestimation, as even people with diabetes who report having intact hypoglycemia, demonstrate impaired awareness of biochemically confirmed hypoglycemia. Although a major clinical problem for people with T1DM, it remains largely unknown what therapeutic agents could possibly be used to treat hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\nWith a goal of identifying existing biological compounds that could restore hypoglycemia awareness, laboratory drug screens were conducted using animal models. It was postulated that an ideal drug would markedly enhance the ability to sense hypoglycemia and trigger a potentially life-saving behavioral response (ie, alert the subject to increase food consumption). The vast majority of tested drugs did not restore hypoglycemia awareness (ie, did not restore blunted food intake response to hypoglycemia). Interestingly, of all the drugs tested, the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide consistently restored hypoglycemia awareness in several preclinical experiments. Additionally, metoclopramide also restored the impaired counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia in the animal model of HAAF.\n\nThis pilot phase II clinical trial (with placebo control) will be conducted to determine if FDA approved doses of Metaclopramdide can restore both, 1) hypoglycemia awareness, and 2) the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM and hypoglycemia unawareness."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypoglycemia Unawareness"],"keywords":["Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"T1DM - Unaware: Metoclopramide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"T1DM participants with hypoglycemia unawareness determined by a hypoglycemic clamp study will receive 10 mg metoclopramide four times a day during the four-week intervention period.","interventionNames":["Drug: Metoclopramide"]},{"label":"T1DM - Unaware: Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"T1DM participants with hypoglycemia unawareness determined by a hypoglycemic clamp study will receive 10 mg matching placebo capsules four times a day during the four-week intervention period.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"T1DM - Aware: Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"T1DM participants with hypoglycemia awareness determined by a hypoglycemic clamp study will receive 10 mg matching placebo capsules four times a day during the four-week intervention period.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Metoclopramide","description":"10 mg metoclopramide four times a day","armGroupLabels":["T1DM - Unaware: Metoclopramide"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"10 mg matching placebo capsules four times a day","armGroupLabels":["T1DM - Aware: Placebo","T1DM - Unaware: Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Blood Glucagon","description":"Blood samples will be drawn from study participants during the initial hypoglycemic clamp study (Day 0) and during the second hypoglycemic clamp study (Day 28) following the 4-week intervention period.
